# Abstract Logic Circuits

#### A Small Collection of Logic Gates and some Basic Circuits


This is the README for the Abstract Logic Circuits library. Its inception began while I was doing some out of the ordinary 
research for my Computer Structures/Architecture class. I spent a fair amount of time learning about the x86 Processor, 
specifically the x86_64 newer variants, and I wanted a way to simulate what I was learning in some sort of game. 
Thankfully I didn't have to go far, and found myself building basic circuits in Fallout 4. I downloaded the PC version, 
and fitted it with a few mods that are must-have for this sort of thing. The first is the ASP - Advanced Settlement 
Power. This one is the back-bones of what I was able to accomplish, and is well cited as the same for the second. 
The second mod was CLC - Complex Logic Circuits. This mod promised to give users a real x86 in the Wasteland, yet it 
was not to be. I was greatly inspired by CLC though, which is in large part why I've chosen a similar name, out of 
respect. Sadly the last version of the DLL that the author shipped with the latest CLC release was only good for
Fallout 4 version 1.10.64. The newest version (I could find) was version 1.10.163, and that's what I'm on. 
Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to find an older version of the game, but the mod still offers a few additional 
tools that aren't present in ASP. Another note is that either the original author or one of the original authors of ASP 
has started a new project called ASPr, or ASP Redux. It's a new version, with some massive overhauls, as well as some 
interesting goals to add new functionality to the project. I'll be very interested in seeing how that goes.

For now the inception of this project is some sort of Node Graph Editor. I'd like to be able to create AND gates and 
XOR gates, and so on, and create my own Logic Circuits from those initial gates.
